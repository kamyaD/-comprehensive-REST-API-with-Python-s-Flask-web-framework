# Python REST APIs With Flask, Connexion, and SQLAlchemy

In this Repository I created a comprehensive REST API with Pythonâ€™s Flask web framework.

Here are some of the skills that this Repository demonstrates:

- Build a base Flask project with a REST API
- Handle HTTP requests with Connexion
- Define API endpoints using the OpenAPI specification
- Interact with  API to manage data
- Build API documentation with Swagger UI
- Writing SQL commands in Python
- Configuring a SQLite database for Flask project
- Using SQLAlchemy to save Python objects to database
- Leverage the Marshmallow library to serialize data
- Connect REST API with database
