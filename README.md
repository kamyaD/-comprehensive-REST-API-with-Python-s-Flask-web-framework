# comprehensive-REST-API-with-Python-s-Flask-web-framework

In this Repository I created a comprehensive REST API with Pythonâ€™s Flask web framework.

Here are some of the skills that this Repository demonstrates:

- Build a base Flask project with a REST API
- Handle HTTP requests with Connexion
- Define API endpoints using the OpenAPI specification
- Interact with  API to manage data
- Build API documentation with Swagger UI
