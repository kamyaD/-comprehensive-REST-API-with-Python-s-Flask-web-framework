# Python REST APIs With Flask, Connexion, and SQLAlchemy

In this Repository I created a comprehensive REST API with Pythonâ€™s Flask web framework.

Here are some of the skills that this Repository demonstrates:

- Building a base Flask project with a REST API
- Handling HTTP requests with Connexion
- Defining API endpoints using the OpenAPI specification
- Interacting with  API to manage data
- Building API documentation with Swagger UI
- Writing SQL commands in Python
- Configuring a SQLite database for Flask project
- Using SQLAlchemy to save Python objects to database
- Leveraging the Marshmallow library to serialize data
- Connecting REST API with database
- Working with multiple tables in a database
- Creating one-to-many fields in a database
- Managing relationships with SQLAlchemy
- Leveraging nested schemas with Marshmallow
- Displaying related objects in the front end
